Jadobe.com
======================================================

**adobe** ( _jah * dough * bee_ ): A building material made from JavaScript used to aid in constructing websites, apps, games and everything in between. Itâ€™s weather resistant and portable, working well in any environment JavaScript can be made to run.

More technically, Jadobe is a shell. It provides several interfaces to directly control and manipulate your target allowing you to easily setup macros for development purposes, modify the environment at runtime, and extend the way you interact with your platform.

Jadobe will let you do anything, quickly. Get excited!

Jadobe is still under intense construction, but is actually complete insofar as the shell goes...I just need to roll out some sweet commands to get ya to rockin! Check out the manual and api at [http://jadobe.com](http://jadobe.com)
